'''
In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues.
The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess:
“Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place,
“Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place,
and “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits.
You have 10 tries to guess the secret number.
